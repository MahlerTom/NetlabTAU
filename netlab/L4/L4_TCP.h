	    \brief
	    TCP input routine, follows pages 65-76 of the protocol specification dated September,
	    1981 very closely.
	    
	    \par 
	    TCP input processing is the largest piece of code that we examine in this text. The
	    function tcp_input() is about 2000 lines of code. The processing of incoming segments is
	    not complicated, just long and detailed. Many implementations, including the one in Net/3,
	    closely follow the input event processing steps in RFC 793, which spell out in detail how
	    to respond to the various input segments, based on the current state of the connection.
	    
	    \par 
	    The tcp_input function is called by ip_input (through the pr_input function in the
	    protocol switch table) when a datagram is received with a protocol field of TCP.
	    tcp_input() executes at the software interrupt level.
	    
	    \par 
	    We first discusses the steps through RST processing, and next the ACK processing.
	    
	    \par 
	    The first few steps are typical: validate the input segment (checksum, length, etc.)
	    and locate the PCB for this connection. Given the length of the remainder of the function,
	    however, an attempt is made to bypass all this logic with an algorithm called header
	    prediction. This algorithm is based on the assumption that segments are not typically
	    lost or reordered, hence for a given connection TCP can often guess what the next
	    received segment will be. If the header prediction algorithm works, notice that the
	    function returns. This is the fast path through tcp_input.
	    
	    \par 
	    The slow path through the function ends up at the label dodata, which tests a few
	    flags and calls tcp_output if a segment should be sent in response to the received
	    segment.
	    
	    \par
	    There are also three functions that are called to when errors occur: dropafterack,
	    dropwithreset, and drop. The term drop means to drop the segment being processed, not
	    drop the connection, but when an RST is sent by dropwithreset it normally causes the
	    connection to be dropped.
	    
	    \par
	    The only other branching in the function occurs when a valid SYN is received in
	    either the LISTEN or SYN_SENT states, at the switch following header prediction. When the
	    code at trimthenstep6 finishes, it jumps to step6, which continues the normal flow.
	    
		\par
	    We test was that either the	ACK flag was set or, if not, the segment was dropped. The ACK
	    flag is handled, the window information is updated, the URG flag is processed, and any
	    data in the segment is processed. Finally the FIN flag is processed and tcp_output is
	    called, if required.
	    
		\par
	    We now explain ACK processing, in a summary. The SYN_RCVD state is handled specially,
	    followed by common processing for all remaining states. (Remember that a received ACK in
	    either the LISTEN or SYN_SENT state was already processed in the beginning.) This is
	    followed by special processing for the three states in which a received ACK causes a
	    state transition, and for the TIME_WAIT state, in which the receipt of an ACK causes the
	    2MSL timer to be restarted.

	    \brief
	    Tcp output routine: figure out what should be sent and send it.

	    \par
	    The function tcp_output is called whenever a segment needs to be sent on a connection.
	    There are numerous calls to this function from other TCP functions:
	    	a.	tcp_usrreq calls it for various requests: PRU_CONNECT to send the initial SYN,
	    		PRU_SHUTDOWN to send a FIN, PRU_RCVD in case a window update can be sent after the
	    		process has read some data from the socket receive buffer, PRU_SEND to send data, and
	    		PRU_SENDOOB to send out-of-band data.
	    	b.	tcp_fasttimo calls it to send a delayed ACK. 
			c.	tcp_tirners calls it to retransmit a segment when the retransmission timer
	    		expires.
	    	d.	tcp_tirners calls it to send a persist probe when the persist timer expires. e.
	    		tcp_drop calls it to send an RST. 
			e.	tcp_disconnect calls it to send a FIN. 
			f.	tcp_input calls it when output is required or when an immediate ACK should
	    		be sent.
	    	g.	tcp_input calls it when a pure ACK is processed by the header prediction
	    		code and there is more data to send. (A pure ACK is a segment without data that just
	    		acknowledges data.)
	    	h.	tcp_input: calls it when the third consecutive duplicate ACK is received, to
	    		send a single segment (the fast retransmit algorithm).
	    \par
	    tcp_output first determines whether a segment should be sent or not. TCP output is
	    controlled by numerous factors other than data being ready to send to the other end of
	    the connection. For example, the other end might be advertising a window of size 0 that
	    stops TCP from sending anything, the Nagle algorithm prevents TCP from sending lots of
	    small segments, and slow start and congestion avoidance limit the amount of data TCP can
	    send on a connection. Conversely, some functions set flags just to force tcp_output to
	    send a segment, such as the TF_ACKNOW flag that means an ACK should be sent immediately
	    and not delayed. If tcp_output decides not to send a segment, the data (if any) is left
	    in the socket's send buffer for a later call to this function.
	    
	    \param	args	The arguments (should implement an inheriting struct).

	    \enum	TCPT_
	
	    \brief
	    The TCPT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions. The TCP has the TCPT_REXMT timer
	    set whenever segments have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet received.
	    If an ACK is received which advances tp-&gt;snd_una, then the retransmit timer is cleared
	    (if there are no more outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there are more
	    ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off, we retransmit one unacknowledged
	    segment, and do a backoff on the retransmit timer.
	    
	    The TCPT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information flowing even if the window
	    goes shut.  If all previous transmissions have been acknowledged (so that there are no
	    retransmissions in progress), and the window is too small to bother sending anything,
	    then we start the TCPT_PERSIST timer.  When it expires, if the window is nonzero, we go
	    to transmit state.  Otherwise, at intervals send a single byte into the peer's window to
	    force him to update our window information. We do this at most as often as TCPT_PERSMIN
	    time intervals, but no more frequently than the current estimate of round-trip packet
	    time.  The TCPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever we receive a window update from the
	    peer.
	    
	    The TCPT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an connection is idle (no
	    segments received) for TCPTV_KEEP_INIT amount of time, but not yet established, then we
	    drop the connection.  Once the connection is established, if the connection is idle for
	    TCPTV_KEEP_IDLE time (and keepalives have been enabled on the socket), we begin to probe
	    the connection.  We force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
	       <SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>
	    This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit an ack segment in
	    response from the peer.  If, despite the TCPT_KEEP initiated segments we cannot elicit a
	    response from a peer in TCPT_MAXIDLE amount of time probing, then we drop the connection.

		\par Update Window Information: 
		There are two variables in the TCP control block that we
		haven't described yet: snd_wl1 and snd_wl2.
			a.	snd_wl1 records the sequence number of the last segment used to update the
	    		send window (snd_wnd).
	    	b.	snd_wl2 records the acknowledgment number of the last segment used to
	    		update the send window.
	    
	    \par 
	    Our only encounter with these variables so far was when a connection was established
	    (active, passive, or simultaneous open) and snd_wl1 was set to ti_seq minus 1. We said
	    this was to guarantee a window update, which we'll see in the following code. The send
	    window (snd_wnd) is updated from the advertised window in the received segment (ti_win)
	    if any one of the following three conditions is true:
	    	1.	The segment contains new data. Since snd_wll contains the starting sequence
	    		number of the last segment that was used to update the send window, if
	    			snd_wl1 &lt; ti_seq
	    		this condition is true.
	    	2.	The segment does not contain new data (snd_wl1 equals ti_seq), but the segment
	    		acknowledges new data. The latter condition is true if
	    			snd_wl2 &lt; ti_ack
	    		since snd_wl2 records the acknowledgment number of the last segment that updated the
	    		send window.
	    	3.	The segment does not contain new data, and the segment does not acknowledge
	    		new data, but the advertised window is larger than the current send window.
	    
	    \par 
	    The purpose of these tests is to prevent an old segment from affecting the send
	    window, since the send window is not an absolute sequence number, but is an offset from
	    snd_una.
	    
	    \par 
	    Check If send window should be updated: This if test verifies that the ACK flag is
	    set along with any one of the three previously stated conditions. Recall that a jump was
	    made to step6 after the receipt of a SYN in either the LISTEN or SYN_SENT state, and in
	    the LISTEN state the SYN does not contain an ACK.

	    Consider the example in Figure 29.20. The urgent offset is 3, therefore the urgent
	    pointer is 7, and the sequence number of the out-ofMband byte is 6. There are 5 bytes in

	    \brief
	    \par
	    Processing of Received Data: tcp_input continues by taking the received data (if any) and
	    either appending it to the socket's receive buffer (if it is the next expected segment)
	    or placing it onto the socket's out-of-order queue. Figure 29.22 shows the code that
	    performs this task.
	    
		\par
	    Segment data is processed if
			1.	the length of the received data is greater than 0 or the FIN flag is set, and 
			2.	a FIN has not yet been received for the connection.

		\par
	    The macro TCP_REASS processes the data. If the data is in sequence (i.e., the next
	    expected data for this connection), the delayed-ACK flag is set, rcv_nxt is incremented,
	    and the data is appended to the socket's receive buffer. If the data is out of order, the
	    macro calls tcp_reass to add the data to the connection's reassembly queue (which might
	    fill a hole and cause already-queued data to be appended to the socket's receive buffer).
	    
		\par
		Recall that the final argument to the macro (tiflags) can be modified. Specifically,
	    if the data is out of order, tcp_reass sets ti flags to 0, clearing the FIN flag (if it
	    was set). That's why the if statement is true if the FIN flag is set even if there is no
	    data in the segment.
	    
		\par Consider the following example.
		A connection is established and the sender immediately transmits three segments: one with
		bytes 1-1024, another with bytes 1025-2048, and another with the FIN flag but no data. 
		The first segment is lost, so when the second arrives (bytes 1025-2048) the receiver 
		places it onto the out-of-order list and generates an immediate ACK. When the third 
		segment with the FIN flag is received. Even though the data length is 0, since the FIN 
		flag is set, TCP_REASS is invoked, which calls tcp_reass. Since ti_seq (2049, the 
		sequence number of the FIN) does not equal rcv_nxt (1), tcp_reass returns 0, which in 
		the TCP_REASS macro sets ti flags to 0. This clears the FIN flag, preventing the code
		that follows from processing the FIN flag.

	    \brief
	    Insert segment ti into reassembly queue of tcp with control block tp. Return TH_FIN if
	    reassembly now includes a segment with FIN. The macro form does the common case inline
	    (segment is the next to be received on an established connection, and the queue is empty),
	    avoiding linkage into and removal from the queue and repetition of various conversions.
	    Set DELACK for segments received in order, but ack immediately when segments are out of
	    order (so fast retransmit can work).
	
	    \param [in,out]	tp   	If non-null, the tcpcb holding the socket to abort.

		\bug
		Since we use smart_pointers, which size is twice the size of a regular pointer, this hack 
		will not work. instead of overloading the port numbers, we will also overload more of parts
		of the header, making this impractical.
		Removing the smart pointers is a huge change to the program, hence, other techniques such
		as expanding the tcpiphdr to include space for the smart pointer, and using dynamic_casting
		is more preferable, however no actual solution was found to this bug, hence the jump to 
		present() is made straightaway.

	    \brief
	    \par 
	    As mentioned earlier, ti can point into the data area of the mbuf pointed to by m,
	    or ti can point into a cluster. Before looking at the code for the tcp_reass function, we
	    need to explain what's done with the two port numbers in the TCP header, ti_sport and
	    ti_dport. Once the TCP control block is located and tcp_reass is called, these two port
	    numbers are no longer needed. Therefore, when a TCP segment is placed on a reassembly
	    queue, the address of the corresponding mbuf is stored over these two port numbers. If
	    the IP and TCP headers are in a cluster (which is the normal case for a full- sized TCP
	    segment), the casting doesn't work. We mentioned in that section that TCP stores its own
	    back pointer from the TCP header to the mbuf, and that back pointer is stored over the
	    two TCP port numbers.
	    
	    \par We shows an example of this technique
	    Given two out-of-order segments for a connection, each segment stored in an mbuf cluster.
		The head of the doubly linked list of out-of-order segments is the seg_next member of the
		control block for this connection. To simplify the figure we don't show the seg_prev 
		pointer and the ti_next pointer of the last segment on the list.
	    
	    \par 
	    The next expected sequence number is 1 (rcv_nxt) but we assume that segment was
	    lost. The next two segments have been received, containing bytes 1461-4380, but they are
	    out of order. The segments were placed into clusters by m_devget.
	    
	    \par 
	    The first 32 bits of the TCP header contain a back pointer to the corresponding
	    mbuf. This back pointer is used in the tcp_reass function, shown next.
	
	    \param [in,out]	tp	a pointer to the TCP control block for the received segment.

	    \brief   
		\par
		The tcp_mss function checks for a cached route to the destination and calculates the MSS
	    to use for this connection. The first part of tcp_mss, which a route to the destination
	    if one is not already held by the PCB.

		\par
	    Determine a reasonable value for maxseg size. If the route is known, check route for
	    mtu. If none, use an mss that can be handled on the outgoing interface without forcing
	    IP to fragment; if bigger than an mbuf cluster (MCLBYTES), round down to nearest
	    multiple of MCLBYTES to utilize large mbufs. If no route is found, route has no mtu, or
	    the destination isn't local, use a default, hopefully conservative size (usually 512 or
	    the default IP max size, but no more than the mtu of the interface), as we can't
	    discover anything about intervening gateways or networks.  We also initialize the
	    congestion/slow start window to be a single segment if the destination isn't local.
	    While looking at the routing entry, we also initialize other path-dependent parameters
	    from pre-set or cached values in the routing entry.

		\par
		The tcp_mss() function is called from two other functions:
			1.	from tcp_output, when a SYN segment is being sent, to include an MSS option, and
			2. 	from tcp_input, when an MSS option is received in a SYN segment.
