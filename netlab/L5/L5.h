		    The socket system call creates a new socket and associates it with a protocol as

		    calls, and returns the descriptor to the process. Before each system call a structure
		    is defined to describe the arguments passed from the process to the kernel. In this

		    system calls have three arguments: p, a pointer to the proc structure for the calling
		    process; uap, a pointer to a structure containing the arguments passed by the process
		    to the system call; and retval, a value-result argument that points to the return
		    value for the system call. Normally, we ignore the p and ret val arguments and refer

		    connect System call: A server process calls the listen and accept system calls to

		    Send on a socket. If send must go all at once and message is larger than send
		    buffering, then hard error. Lock against other senders. If must go all at once and
		    not enough room now, then inform user that this would block and do nothing. Otherwise,
		    if nonblocking, send as much as possible. The data to be sent is described by "uio"
		    if nonzero, otherwise by the mbuf chain "top" (which must be null if uio is not).
		    Data provided in mbuf chain must be small enough to send all at once. sosend
		    Function: sosend is one of the most complicated functions in the socket layer. Recall
		    from Figure 16.8 that all five write calls eventually call sosend. It is sosend's
		    responsibility to pass the data and control information to the pr_usrreq function of
		    the protocol associated with the socket according to the semantics supported by the
		    protocol and the buffer limits specified by the socket. sosend never places data in
		    the send buffer; it is the protocol's responsibility to store and remove the data.
		    The interpretation of the send buffer's sb_hiwat and sb_lowat values by sosend
		    depends on whether the associated protocol implements reliable or unreliable data
		    transfer semantics.
		    
		    Reliable Protocol Buffering: For reliable protocols, the send buffer holds both data
		    that has not yet been transmitted and data that has been sent, but has not been
		    acknowledged. sb_cc is the number of bytes of data that reside in the send buffer,
		    and 0 &lt;= sb_cc &lt;= sb_hiwat. Remark:	sb_cc may temporarily exceed sb_hiwat when
		    out-of-band data is sent. It is sosend's responsibility to ensure that there is
		    enough space in the send buffer before passing any data to the protocol layer through
		    the pr_usrreq function. The protocol layer adds the data to the send buffer. sosend
		    transfers data to the protocol in one of two ways: a.	If PR_ATOMIC is set, sosend
		    must preserve the message boundaries between the process and the protocol layer. In
		    this case, sosend waits for enough space to become available to hold the entire
		    message. When the space is available, an mbuf chain containing the entire message is
		    constructed and passed to the protocol in a single call through the pr_usrreq
		    function. RDP and SPP are examples of this type of protocol. b.	If PR_ATOMIC is not
		    set, sosend passes the message to the protocol one mbuf at a time and may pass a
		    partial mbuf to avoid exceeding the high-water mark. This method is used with
		    SOCK_STREAM protocols such as TCP and SOCK_SEQPACKET protocols such as TP4. With TP4,
		    record boundaries are indicated explicitly with the MSG_EOR flag (Figure 16.12), so
		    it is not necessary for the message boundaries to be preserved by sosend. TCP
		    applications have no control over the size of outgoing TCP segments. For example, a
		    message of 4096 bytes sent on a TCP socket will be split by the socket layer into two
		    mbufs with external clusters, containing 2048 bytes each, assuming there is enough
		    space in the send buffer for 4096 bytes. Later, during protocol processing, TCP will
		    segment the data according to the maximum segment size for the connection, which is
		    normally less than 2048. When a message is too large to fit in the available buffer
		    space and the protocol allows messages to be split, sosend still does not pass data
		    to the protocol until the free space in the buffer rises above sb_lowat. For TCP,
		    sb_lowat defaults to 2048 (Figure 16.4), so this rule prevents the socket layer from
		    bothering TCP with small chunks of data when the send buffer is nearly full.
		    
		    Unreliable Protocol Buffering: With unreliable protocols (e.g., UDP), no data is ever
		    stored in the send buffer and no acknowledgment is ever expected. Each message is
		    passed immediately to the protocol where it is queued for transmission on the
		    appropriate network device. In this case, sb_cc is always 0, and sb_hiwat specifies
		    the maximum size of each write and indirectly the maximum size of a datagram. Figure
		    16.4 shows that sb_hiwat defaults to 9216(9x1024) for UDP. Unless the process changes
		    sb_hiwat with the SO_SNDBUF socket option, an attempt to write a datagram larger than
		    9216 bytes returns with an error. Even then, other limitations of the protocol
		    implementation may prevent a process from sending large datagrams. Section 11.10 of
		    Volume 1 discusses these defaults and limits in other TCP /IP implementations.
		    Remark:	9216 is large enough for a NFS write, which often defaults to 8192 bytes of
		    data plus protocol headers.
		    
		    The arguments to sosend are: so, a pointer to the relevant socket; addr, a pointer to
		    a destination address; uio, a pointer to a uio structure describing the I/O buffers
		    in user space; top, an mbuf chain that holds data to be sent; control, an mbuf that
		    holds control information to be sent; and flags, which contains options for this
		    write call. Normally, a process provides data to the socket layer through the uio
		    mechanism and top is null. When the kernel itself is using the socket layer (such as
		    with NFS), the data is passed to sosend as an mbuf chain pointed to by top, and uio
		    is null.
		    	    
		    throws nonzero on error, timeout or signal; callers must check for short counts if
		    EINTR/ERESTART are returned. Data and control buffers are freed on return.

		    \brief
		    Optimized version of soreceive() for stream (TCP) sockets. XXXAO: (MSG_WAITALL |
		    MSG_PEEK) isn't properly handled.
		    
		    Implement receive operations on a socket. We depend on the way that records are added
		    to the sockbuf by sbappend*.  In particular, each record (mbufs linked through m_next)
		    must begin with an address if the protocol so specifies, followed by an optional mbuf
		    or mbufs containing ancillary data, and then zero or more mbufs of data. In order to
		    avoid blocking network interrupts for the entire time here, we splx() while doing the
		    actual copy to user space. Although the sockbuf is locked, new data may still be
		    appended, and thus we must maintain consistency of the sockbuf during that time.
		    
		    The caller may receive the data as a single mbuf chain by supplying an mbuf **mp0 for
		    use in returning the chain.  The uio is then used only for the count in uio_resid.
		    
		    This function transfers data from the receive buffer of the socket to the buffers
		    specified by the process. Some protocols provide an address specifying the sender of
		    the data, and this can be returned along with additional control information that may
		    be present. Before examining the code, we need to discuss the semantics of a receive
		    operation, out-of-band data, and the organization of a socket's receive buffer.

		    Out-of-Band Data: Out-of-band (OOB) data semantics vary widely among protocols. In
		    general, protocols expedite OOB data along a previously established communication
		    link. The OOB data might not remain in sequence with previously sent regular data.
		    The socket layer supports two mechanisms to facilitate handling OOB data in a
		    protocol-independent way: tagging and synchronization. In this chapter we describe
		    the abstract OOB mechanisms implemented by the socket layer. UDP does not support OOB
		    data. The relationship between TCP's urgent data mechanism and the socket OOB
		    n1echanism is described in the TCP chapters. A sending process tags data as OOB data
		    by setting the MSG_OOB flag in any of the sendxxx calls. sosend passes this
		    information to the socket's protocol, which provides any special services, such as
		    expediting the data or using an alternate queuing strategy. When a protocol receives
		    OOB data, the data is set aside instead of placing it in the socket's receive buffer.
		    A process receives the pending OOB data by setting the MSG_OOB flag in one of the
		    recvxxx calls. Alternatively, the receiving process can ask the protocol to place OOB
		    data inline with the regular data by setting the SO_OOBINLINB socket option (Section
		    17.3). When SO_OOBINLINE is set, the protocol places incoming OOB data in the receive
		    buffer with the regular data. In this case, MSG_OOB is not used to receive the OOB
		    data. Read calls return either all regular data or all OOB data. The two types are
		    never mixed in the input buffers of a single input system call. A process that uses
		    recvmsg to receive data can examine the MSG_OOB flag to determine if the returned
		    data is regular data or OOB data that has been placed inline. The socket layer
		    supports synchronization of OOB and regular data by allowing the protocol layer to
		    mark the point in the regular data stream at which OOB data was received. The
		    receiver can determine when it has reached this mark by using the SIOCATMARK ioctl
		    command after each read system call. When receiving regular data, the socket layer
		    ensures that only the bytes preceding the mark are returned in a single message so
		    that the receiver does not inadvertently pass the mark. If additional OOB data is
		    received before the receiver reaches the mark, the mark is silently advanced.
		    
		    soreceive has six arguments. so is a pointer to the socket. A pointer to an mbuf to
		    receive address information is returned in *paddr. If mp0 points to an mbuf pointer,
		    soreceive transfers the receive buffer data to an mbuf chain pointed to by *mp0. In
		    this case, the uio structure is used only for the count in uio_resid. If mp0 is null,
		    soreceive copies the data into buffers described by the uio structure. A pointer to
		    the mbuf containing control information is returned in *controlp, and soreceive
		    returns the flags described in Figure 16.33 in *flagsp.

		    soisdisconnecting() is called during processing of disconnect() call, and
		    soisdisconnected() is called when the connection to the peer is totally severed.  The
		    semantics of these routines are such that connectionless protocols can call
		    soisconnected() and soisdisconnected()
		    only, bypassing the in-progress calls when setting up a ``connection'' takes no time.
		    
		    From the passive side, a socket is created with two queues of sockets: so_q0 for
		    connections in progress and so_q for connections already made and awaiting user
		    acceptance. As a protocol is preparing incoming connections, it creates a socket
		    structure queued on so_q0 by calling sonewconn().  When the connection is established,
		    soisconnected() is called, and transfers the socket structure to so_q, making it
		    available to accept().
		    
		    If a socket is closed with sockets on either so_q0 or so_q, these sockets are dropped.
		    
		    If higher level protocols are implemented in the kernel, the wakeups done here will
		    sometimes cause software-interrupt process scheduling.
